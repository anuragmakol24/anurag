MONGAS
Mongaâ€™s has held an imperial legacy of fine craftsmanship in Haute and Pret Couture since 1996. Our founders Mr Arun Monga & Mrs Reena Monga started our humble journey. The company began by exporting fashion to other designers boutiques in the UK in 1996, but customer popularity led the business to open its first boutique in London in 2004. Since then it has built up a reputation as one of the leading Asian designer brands in the world.
